# Using GitHub

## Creating repositories
Repositories are for discreet applications. Repository names should start with a project prefix and then the name of the application. Prefixes are:
| Prefix | Project Name |
|---|---|
| chil- | Prefix for global projects or information for the Civic Health Innovation Labs | 
| cgull- | Children Growing Up in LiverpooL |
| mric- | Mental Health Research for Innovation Centre projects, including TRE |

Repository names should be all lower case with words divided by a dash for readability. E.g. chil-dev-docs

## Naming files
[TODO] Do we need different standards for different programming languages?
