# Personas and Use Cases

When defining a project it is useful to think about the personas, the actors who will engage with the system, and the journeys and use cases they will need to complete in order to use the system effectively.

These user journeys and use cases can be described in a diagram or as user stories in text. Examples are below:

## Personas
| Persona Name | Description |
|---|---|

## Use Cases

| 1. | As a User I want to be able to access a sample of anonymised, structured clinical data and unstructured clinical notes in order to undertake scientific, statistical analysis, and build new machine learning models and algorithms | Epic 1 | Feature |
| 2. | As a User I want to be able to report and quarantine data if I find there is an error with the anonymisation in order to manage disclosure risk | Epic 1 | Feature |
| 3. | As a Data Wrangler I want to be able to create rules to clean the data, such as managing incorrect formats or outliers, in order to support the analysis | Epic 2 | Feature |
