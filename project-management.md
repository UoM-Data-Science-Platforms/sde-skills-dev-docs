# Project Management

CHIL technical projects are managed using an [agile](http://agilemanifesto.org) methodology. 

The overarching software objectives will be described in User Stories, grouped into Epics of related functionality. An [example of how this works](https://github.com/civic-health-innovation-labs/mric-docs/wiki/Epic-and-Milestone-Overview) can be found in the MRIC wiki.

Projects are managed through twice weekly stand up meetings, usually held online, to review the project task list and backlog. Additionally, once per week, a retrospective will be held to review progress, share a demo of work from a volunteer and potentially identify any further planning that needs to be done. This is managed through GitHub Projects.
